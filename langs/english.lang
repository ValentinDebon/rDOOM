Deimos floats above Hell itself!

fair -- for you emerge from the door

Guardian.  With its death, you've wrested
the Accelerator from the stinking claws

least one working prototype, but you can't
see it. The demons must have taken it.

few remaining demons.  You're done. Hell

experimental labs.   It seems that UAC has
once again gulped it down.  With their
high turnover, it must be hard for poor

nowadays..

Ahead lies the military complex, now
swarming with diseased horrors hot to get
their teeth into you. With luck, the
complex still has some warlike ordnance
laying around."
F_T2TEXT="You hear the grinding of heavy machinery
ahead.  You sure hope they're not stamping
out new hellspawn, but you're ready to
ream out a whole herd if you have to.
They might be planning a blood feast, but
you feel about as mean as two thousand
maniacs packed into one mad killer.

You don't plan to go down easy."

familiar. Smells familiar, too -- like
fried excrement. You didn't like this

Hefting your gun, an evil grin trickles
onto your face. Time to take some names."

to the other. The agonizing echo of Hell
fades away, the nightmare sky turns to
blue, the heaps of monster corpses start 
to evaporate along with the evil stench 
that filled the air. Jeeze, maybe you've
done it. Have you really won?

Something rumbles in the distance.
A blue light begins to glow inside the
ruined skull of the demon-spitter."
F_T5TEXT="What now? Looks totally different. Kind
of like King Tut's condo. Well,
whatever's here can't be any worse

bowels of hell and by golly you're ready
for a break. You mutter to yourself,

buildings, and presumably no Hellspawn.

As you step off the transport, you hear
the stomp of a cyberdemon's iron shoe."
